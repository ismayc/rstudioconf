# Why is this needed?

---

## Guiding Principles of ModernDive

## 1. Blur the lines between lecture and lab

```{r out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/giphy1.gif")
```


---

## 2. Focus on the data/science research pipeline

```{r out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hadley.png")
```

---

## 3. It's all about the data

### - Use the `tidyverse` with rich, interesting, open data sets

```{r out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
gg <- image_read("images/ggplot2.png") %>% 
  image_background("none")
dpl <- image_read("images/dplyr.png") %>% 
  image_background("none")
br <- image_read("images/broom.png") %>% 
  image_background("none")
rmd <- image_read("images/rmarkdown.png") %>% 
  image_background("none")
rs <- image_read("images/rstudio.png") %>% 
  image_background("none")
hex <- c(gg, dpl, br, rmd, rs)
hex_side <- image_append(hex)
image_write(hex_side, "images/magick/hex_side.png", format = "png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/magick/hex_side.png", dpi = 50)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2movies)
library(okcupiddata)
library(gapminder)
library(babynames)
```


---

## 4. Use simulation/resampling not probability/large sample approximation

### - Reinforce concepts, not equations, formulas, and probability tables

### - Have data visualization be the driver

```{r, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ht.png", dpi = 180)
```

---

## 5. Don’t fence off students from the computation pool, throw them in!

### - Scaffold & support as a good foreign language professor would

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/giphy2.gif")
```

---

## 6. Complete reproducibility with `bookdown`

### - Put it all out there

### - Ultimately the best textbook is one you’ve written yourself

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/precious.gif")
```

# Teaching the `tidyverse`

## Introducing students to <small>`ggplot2`</small>

```{r}
simple_ex <- data_frame(
    A = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    B = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    C = c(3, 2, 1, 2),
    D = c("a", "a", "b", "b")
  )
```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = simple_ex, mapping = aes(x = A, y = B)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    A = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    B = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    C = c(3, 2, 1, 2),
    D = c("a", "a", "b", "b")
  )
```

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = simple_ex, mapping = aes(x = A, y = B)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Teaching the Grammar of Graphics via chalk talk

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = simple_ex, mapping = aes(x = A, y = B, color = D)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Reverse engineering

- What `dplyr` and `ggplot2` code is needed to produce this plot using the `profiles` data frame in `okcupiddata`?

```{r fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5.5}
profiles %>% 
  filter(between(age, 20, 50)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = status, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "20 < age < 50", x = "status\n") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
```

## Why use `bookdown` 

### - Rapid iteration and easily-updateable
###  - Exports book to multiple formats
###  - Slick cross-references
###  - Textbook has versions not editions
###  - Wikipedia model for intro stats/data science

# Debuting <small>`fivethirtyeight`</small> 

```{r, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("images/fallon.gif")
```

---

## Features of <small>`fivethirtyeight`</small>  

***

### Data sets that balance being

### - **rich enough** to answer meaningful questions with, 
### - **real enough** to ensure that there is context, and 
### - **realistic enough** to convey to students that data as it exists <br> "in the wild" often needs processing.

---

## What's to come

### Add more interactive shiny apps into the book

### Create more Review Questions at chapter ends using <small>`fivethirtyeight`</small> and other open data sources

### Design and share instructor resources

### Create DataCamp course to supplement and assist with more immediate feedback

Distinguish the how from the what
What is the focus


Story of teaching intro stats
Making stats not math anymore
  - Make it computation	

Why we did this

And this is how we teach dplyr and ggplot2
  - The verb is the command
  - Put tickmarks throughout the book to differentiate the language
  - The slow patient approach on the blackboard
  - what (no R code) from the how (or any other implementation of the graphics - plotly, tableau)
  - forward engineering and reverse engineer

Why Bookdown 
  - rapid iteration
  - Exports to multiple formats
  - Cross-references
  - Easily-updateable
  - Versions not editions (continual improvement)
  - Software engineering principles bringing it to books in subjects that lend well
      - Maybe not theory-stats
  - Following Hadley's paradigm of wikipedia for intro stats/data science

fivethirtyeight
  - Released to CRAN on ...
  - finding relevant, interesting data sets
  - tidy data principle manifesto for intro stats
  - R packages are excellent for distributing data
  - Example problem

Contribute
Remember back to when you were first learning R
  - What do you wish you knew then that you know now
  - What should we tell our students?
  - Fix our stuff!
    - No graduate students and no grants

What’s wrong with the textbook industry?  Maybe this is a solution
