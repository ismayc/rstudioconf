# Why is this needed?

---

## Guiding Principles of ModernDive

## 1. Blur the lines between lecture and lab

&lt;img src="images/giphy1.gif" width="75%" /&gt;


---

## 2. Focus on the data/science research pipeline

&lt;img src="images/hadley.png" width="100%" /&gt;

---

## 3. It's all about the data

### - Use the `tidyverse` with rich, interesting, open data sets

&lt;img src="images/magick/hex_side.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


```r
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2movies)
library(okcupiddata)
library(gapminder)
library(babynames)
```


---

## 4. Use simulation/resampling not probability/large sample approximation

### - Reinforce concepts, not equations, formulas, and probability tables

### - Have data visualization be the driver

&lt;img src="images/ht.png" width="597" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## 5. Don’t fence off students from the computation pool, throw them in!

### - Scaffold &amp; support as a good foreign language professor would

&lt;img src="images/giphy2.gif" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## 6. Complete reproducibility with `bookdown`

### - Put it all out there

### - Ultimately the best textbook is one you’ve written yourself

## Introducing students to `ggplot2`




```r
ggplot(data = simple_ex, mapping = aes(x = A, y = B)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Reverse engineering

- What `dplyr` and `ggplot2` code is needed to produce this plot using the `profiles` data frame in `okcupiddata`?

![](slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;!--
- What effective data stories can you tell with this data based on the distributions above for males and females?
--&gt;

---

## Why use `bookdown` 

### - Rapid iteration and easily-updateable
###  - Exports book to multiple formats
###  - Slick cross-references
###  - Textbook has versions not editions
###  - Wikipedia model for intro stats/data science

# Debuting &lt;small&gt;`fivethirtyeight`&lt;/small&gt;

## Features of &lt;small&gt;`fivethirtyeight`&lt;/small&gt;  

***

### Data sets that balance being

### - **rich enough** to answer meaningful questions with, 
### - **real enough** to ensure that there is context, and 
### - **realistic enough** to convey to students that data as it exists &lt;br&gt; "in the wild" often needs processing.

---

## What's to come

### Add more interactive shiny apps into the book

### Create more Review Questions at chapter ends using &lt;small&gt;`fivethirtyeight`&lt;/small&gt; and other open data sources

### Design and share instructor resources

### Create DataCamp course to supplement and assist with more immediate feedback

What is the focus


Story of teaching intro stats
Making stats not math anymore
  - Make it computation	

Why we did this

And this is how we teach dplyr and ggplot2
  - The verb is the command
  - Put tickmarks throughout the book to differentiate the language
  - The slow patient approach on the blackboard
  - what (no R code) from the how (or any other implementation of the graphics - plotly, tableau)
  - forward engineering and reverse engineer

Why Bookdown 
  - rapid iteration
  - Exports to multiple formats
  - Cross-references
  - Easily-updateable
  - Versions not editions (continual improvement)
  - Software engineering principles bringing it to books in subjects that lend well
      - Maybe not theory-stats
  - Following Hadley's paradigm of wikipedia for intro stats/data science

fivethirtyeight
  - Released to CRAN on ...
  - finding relevant, interesting data sets
  - tidy data principle manifesto for intro stats
  - R packages are excellent for distributing data
  - Example problem

Contribute
Remember back to when you were first learning R
  - What do you wish you knew then that you know now
  - What should we tell our students?
  - Fix our stuff!
    - No graduate students and no grants

What’s wrong with the textbook industry?  Maybe this is a solution
